What does the len() function do in Python? Write a code example using len() to find the length of a list.
The len() function is used to determine the number of items in an iterable (such as a list, string, tuple, or dictionary). It returns an integer representing the length of the object.

Write a Python function greet(name) that takes a person's name as input and prints "Hello, [name]!".
A function greet(name) is created to take a person's name as input and print a greeting message.

Write a Python function find_maximum(numbers) that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum value without using the built-in max() function. Use a loop to iterate through the list and compare values.
The function find_maximum(numbers) finds the highest value in a list using a loop instead of the built-in max() function.

Explain the difference between local and global variables in a Python function. Write a program where a global variable and a local variable have the same name and show how Python differentiates between them.
Global Variable: A variable declared outside any function. It can be accessed and modified inside functions using the global keyword.
Local Variable: A variable declared inside a function. It is only accessible within that function.

Create a function calculate_area(length, width=5) that calculates the area of a rectangle. If only the length is provided, the function should assume the width is 5. Show how the function behaves when called with and without the width argument.
A function calculate_area(length, width=5) calculates the area of a rectangle. If only the length is provided, it assumes the width is 5.
If both length and width are provided, the function multiplies them normally.

If only length is provided, width defaults to 5.
